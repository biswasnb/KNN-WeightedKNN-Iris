# KNN and Weighted KNN Implementation on Iris Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (Weighted KNN) algorithms using Euclidean distance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in this project. It is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks, containing three classes of iris plants:
1. Setosa
2. Versicolor
3. Virginica
